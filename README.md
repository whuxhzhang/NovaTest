# NovaTest

## Introduce
Novatest is a driverless development assistant software developed by Beijing superstar future Co., Ltd. based on unreal 4 engine and Carla simulator, which is used for unmanned driving development and test phase. It not only supports R & D engineers to verify algorithm performance in the process of function development, but also supports testers to test vehicle performance systematically. Novatest can fully empower your driverless system development process, accelerate the R & D progress, and promote the project landing.

At present, the software supports the simulation of decision-making, planning and control modules in unmanned driving system. The main functions of classic traffic scene simulation, scene batch simulation and continuous scene simulation have been realized. At the same time, the software development team continues to develop the software iteratively with high efficiency, and enriches the software content and function regularly.

If you have any questions in the use process, you can record them on the Issues. We will answer those questions one by one.
